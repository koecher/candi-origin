# ubuntu 12
#
# This build script assumes that you have several packages already
# installed via ubuntu's apt-get using the following commands:
#
# > sudo apt-get install build-essential automake autoconf texinfo gfortran \
#        openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi-dev cmake subversion \
#        git libblas-dev liblapack-dev libblas3gf liblapack3gf splint \
#        tcl tcl-dev libsuitesparse-dev libtool libboost-all-dev qt4-dev-tools
#
# Then reboot.
#
# Afterwards, you should set your compilers safely:
# > export CC=mpicc; export CXX=mpicxx; export FC=mpif90; export FF=mpif77
# and rerun candi again.
#
# To compile deal.II applications, you need to set the following variables
# > export DEAL_II_DIR=${INSTALL_PATH} (see below for your settings)
# > export PATH=$DEAL_II_DIR/bin:$PATH
##

#
# Define the additional packages for this platform.
PACKAGES="once:cmake once:autoconf once:automake ${PACKAGES}"

# The default compiler on ubuntu12 does not support Trilinos 12.
# Anyhow, the user can decide to use Trilinos 11 or 12, if the
# version number is not set to AUTO.
# The last point is due to own compilers (e.g. intel) which support
# Trilinos 12.
if [ ${TRILINOS_MAJOR_VERSION} == "AUTO" ]; then
